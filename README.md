Write a Python function that performs the following tasks:


1. Define a function `math_operations` that takes two numbers as input.

2. Inside this function:

   - Use a lambda function to calculate the sum of the two numbers and return it.

   - Use another lambda function to calculate the product of the two numbers and return it.

   - Use a docstring to explain what the function does.

3. Create another function `main` that:

   - Calls the `math_operations` function with sample numbers got from user input, for example, `5` and `3`.

   - Prints the returned sum and product.


Requirements:


- Use appropriate function arguments and return statements.

- Demonstrate an understanding of lambda functions and their usage.

- Implement proper scope management.

- Include a docstring for the `math_operations` function.


Example Output:



Sum: 8
Product: 15
